  "body": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nThe Marioni group is based at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute. We are involved in developing novel statistical and computational methods for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This webpage serves as an index for our code repositories, including software packages and analysis scripts for various projects.\r\n\r\n# Software\r\n\r\n- The _scran_ package is designed for low-level analyses of scRNA-seq data. It is officially available as part of the open-source Bioconductor project (http://bioconductor.org/packages/scran), but the in-house experimental version can be obtained at https://github.com/MarioniLab/scran.\r\n\r\n# Projects\r\n\r\n- Simulation code for the normalization-by-pooling paper ([Genome Biology, 2016](http://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0947-7)) can be obtained at https://github.com/MarioniLab/Deconvolution2016.\r\n- The scRNA-seq low-level analysis workflow based on _scran_ and other Bioconductor packages can be obtained at https://github.com/MarioniLab/BiocWorkflow2016.\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nThis page is maintained by various members of the Marioni Lab. For information about code, contact Aaron Lun (aaron dot lun at cruk dot cam dot ac dot uk) or the authors of the individual repositories. For information about the group, contact John Marioni (marioni at ebi dot ac dot uk).\r\n\r\n# Links\r\n\r\n- CRUK homepage: http://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk/research-groups/marioni-group\r\n- EMBL-EBI homepage: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/marioni\r\n- GitHub page: https://github.com/MarioniLab",
